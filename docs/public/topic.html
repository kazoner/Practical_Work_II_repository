                <h3>Hinotori robot overview</h3>
                <p>The Hinotori™ Surgical Robot System is a robotic platform designed to assist surgeons during minimally invasive surgeries. It was developed by Medicaroid Corporation, a Japanese company formed in 2013 through a partnership between Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Sysmex Corporation. The system enhances the surgeon's precision, helping to improve patient outcomes.</p>

                <h3>Japan First Homegrown Surgical Robot </h3>
                <p>In August 2020, the Hinotori™ robot became the first robotic surgery system made in Japan to receive official approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW). This was a significant achievement, showing Japan's ability to innovate in advanced medical technology.</p>

                <h3>Compact Design for Better Operations</h3>
                <p> The Hinotori™ system has a patient-side cart with four arms (used for holding instruments and cameras).The arms are arranged in a crane-like way, making the system compact and easy to move around in the operating room. This design ensures it does not take up too much space, which is important in busy hospitals.</p>
